# Tips for solving DSA questions


# General Tips
1. Listen carefully 
	-> Lookout for every detail mentioned in the question
	-> are you using all the relevant details that are mentioned in the problem definition


2. Draw an example 
	-> But be careful, you should use a example which is general to the problem
		-> Not a special case
	-> sufficient large example "not very small"

	
3. State a brute force solution
	-> once you have the example, immediately come up with a Brute Force solution
	
	
4. optimize your solution
	-> Look for any unused infomation (which is mentioned in the problem definition )
	-> Use a fresh example ( that will help you to see the problem from different prespective )
	-> solve it "incorrectly" ( like having brute force solution will help to find the optimize one similarly having the incorrect/partially correct solution will help to find the right solution )
	-> make time vs. space trade off
	-> precompute information
	-> use a hash table
	-> Think about best conceivable time 
	
5. Implement
6. Test 



# Optimization Techniques
1. Look for BUD ( BottleNecks, Unneccessary work, Duplicated work )
2. Do it Yourself ( Grab a pen and paper, and find out the solution for the problem )
3. Simplify and Generalize
4. Base case and build
5. Data Structure Brainstrom
6. Best conceivable runtime (BCR) 
	-> tells you about the best acheivable time complexity
	-> also tells you about that we are done optimizing the time complexity and we can play with the space complexity of our solution
